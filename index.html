    <li> licensing obligations
			that Working Group participants will undertake

   <p>All numbered sections of this document (1-8),

   <h2 class="heading settled" data-level="2" id="sec-Licensing"><span class="secno">2. </span><span class="content"> Licensing Goals for W3C Recommendations</span><a class="self-link" href="#sec-Licensing"></a></h2>
   <p>In order to promote the widest adoption of Web standards,
	W3C seeks to issue Recommendations
	that can be implemented on a <a href="#def-RF" id="ref-for-def-RF">Royalty-Free</a> (RF) basis.
	Subject to the conditions of this policy,
	W3C will not approve a Recommendation
	if it is aware that <a href="#def-essential">Essential Claims</a> exist
	which are not available on Royalty-Free terms.</p>
   <p>To this end,
	Working Group charters will include a reference to this policy
	and a requirement that specifications produced by the Working Group
	will be implementable on an RF basis,
	to the best ability of the Working Group and the Consortium.</p>
   <h2 class="heading settled" data-level="3" id="sec-Obligations"><span class="secno">3. </span><span class="content"> Licensing Obligations of Working Group Participants</span><a class="self-link" href="#sec-Obligations"></a></h2>
   <p>The following obligations shall apply to all participants in W3C Working Groups.
	These obligations will be referenced from each Working Group charter
	and Calls for Participation.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="3.1" id="sec-W3C-RF-license"><span class="secno">3.1. </span><span class="content"> W3C RF Licensing Requirements for All Working Group Participants</span><a class="self-link" href="#sec-W3C-RF-license"></a></h3>
   <p>As a condition of participating in a Working Group,
	each participant
	(W3C Members,
	W3C Team members,
	invited experts,
	and members of the public)
	shall agree to make available under <a href="#def-RF" id="ref-for-def-RF①">W3C RF licensing requirements</a> any <a href="#def-essential">Essential Claims</a> related to the work of that particular Working Group.
	This requirement includes Essential Claims that the participant owns
	and any that the participant has the right to license
	without obligation of payment
	or other consideration to an unrelated third party.
	With the exception of the provisions of section 4 below,
	W3C RF licensing obligations made concerning the work of the particular Working Group
	and described in this policy are binding on participants
	for the life of the patents in question
	and encumber the patents containing <a href="#def-essential">Essential Claims</a>,
	regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership.</p>
   <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="3.2" id="sec-non-participants"><span class="secno">3.2. </span><span class="content"> Limitation on Licensing Requirement for Non-Participating Members</span><a class="self-link" href="#sec-non-participants"></a></h3>
   <p>Only the affirmative act of joining a Working Group,
	or otherwise agreeing to the licensing terms described here,
	will obligate a Member to the W3C RF licensing commitments.
	Mere Membership in W3C alone,
	without other factors,
	does not give rise to the RF licensing obligation under this policy.</p>

	all Submitters
	and any others who provide patent licenses associated with the submitted document
	must indicate whether or not
	each entity (Submitters and other licensors) will offer a license
	according to the <a href="#def-RF" id="ref-for-def-RF②">W3C RF licensing requirements</a> for any portion of the Member Submission
	that is subsequently incorporated in a W3C Recommendation.
	The W3C Team may acknowledge the Member Submission
	if the answer to the licensing commitment is either affirmative or negative,
	and shall not acknowledge the Member Submission if no response is provided.</p>

   <p>After having made every effort to resolve the conflict

	the PAG, by <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#def-Consensus" id="ref-for-def-Consensus">consensus</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">PROCESS, section 3.3</a>],
	may propose that specifically identified patented technology
	be included in the Recommendation
	even though such claims are not available
	according to the W3C RF licensing requirements of this policy
	("PAG Proposal").
	The PAG Proposal must explain:</p>
   <ul>
    <li> why the chartered goals of the Working Group cannot be met
			without inclusion of the identified technology; 
    <li> how the proposed licensing terms
			will be consistent with widespread adoption. 
   </ul>
   <p>The PAG Proposal must include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li> a complete list of claims
			and licensing terms of the proposed alternative arrangements;
			and, 
    <li> a proposed charter for the Working Group,
			unless the Recommendation has been issued
			and no new work is required. 
   </ul>
   <p>If the Director determines
	that the PAG Proposal is the best alternative consistent with the W3C mission,
	the interests of the Web community,
	and is clearly justified
	despite the expressed preference of the W3C Membership for RF licensing,
	then the PAG Proposal shall be circulated for public comment
	and Advisory Committee review.
	The Director may also circulate the PAG Proposal
	for Advisory Committee review without such endorsement.
	Should the PAG Proposal be rejected,
	then either sub-paragraph 4 or 5 of section 7.5.3 will apply as appropriate,
	without further action of the Advisory Committee.
	Members of the Working Group who are bound to RF terms
	are not released from their obligations by virtue of the PAG Proposal alone.
	As with any newly chartered Working Group,
	new commitments must be made,
	along with possible exclusions.
	In order to expedite the process,
	the PAG Proposal should consider
	whether additional claims would be excluded
	under the new charter and include such information in the PAG Proposal.</p>
